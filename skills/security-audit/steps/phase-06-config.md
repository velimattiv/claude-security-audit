# Phase 6 — Config + Methodology Spine

## 🛑 MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

📋 **This phase MUST produce, on disk, before advancing:**
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-config.json` (CORS / headers / cookies / errors / env / rate-limit / transport / CI-CD findings)
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-asvs.jsonl` (one row per ASVS L2 sub-item where relevant)
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-api-top10.jsonl` (per-surface mapping to API Top 10 2023)
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-llm-top10.jsonl` — ALWAYS written. If `profile.llm_usage.detected == false` or `kind == "internal"`, write a zero-byte file (the file's presence is the signal that the gate ran).
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-web-top10.jsonl` — ALWAYS written. One row per OWASP Top 10:2025 (web) category (A01..A10) with counts + pointers (§6.16). A pure roll-up from existing findings' CWEs; never gated.
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-agentic-top10.jsonl` — ALWAYS written. If `profile.mcp_agentic.detected != true`, write a zero-byte file (the file's presence is the signal that the gate ran). Otherwise one row per ASI01..ASI10 (§6.17).
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-linddun.jsonl` — ALWAYS written. If `profile.pii.detected == false`, write a zero-byte file.
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-stride/*.md` — one Markdown file per top-N partition (filename uses the partition id, e.g. `services-api.md`)
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-egress.jsonl` — Authorized-Egress reconciliation findings (§6.19). ALWAYS written; zero-byte only when `phase-02-sinks.json` has no sinks.
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-collections.jsonl` — collection-scoping reconciliation findings (§6.20). ALWAYS written; zero-byte only when `phase-02-collections.json` has no collections.
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06.done`

🔁 **Methodology fan-out is MANDATORY (per §6.9, §6.12, §6.13):**
- ASVS: invoke one Agent sub-agent per ASVS category. Do NOT summarize all ASVS categories in a single pass.
- LINDDUN: invoke a sub-agent per (entity × threat-category) when PII is detected.
- STRIDE: invoke a sub-agent per top-N partition.

⛔ **DO NOT advance to Phase 7** until every file above exists (empty JSONLs are fine for legitimately-gated methodologies) AND the Verify block prints `phase-06 verified`.

📖 Phase 7 synthesis computes the methodology coverage matrix from these JSONLs. Empty-when-shouldn't-be-empty or missing methodology files ⇒ the report's "Methodology Coverage" section is misleading.

---

**Goal.** Audit whole-application configuration (CORS, security headers,
cookies, error handling, env-var exposure, transport config, outbound-
client config, CI/CD pipeline) AND apply the structured OWASP
methodology spines (ASVS, API Top 10, LLM Top 10, LINDDUN, STRIDE).

**Inputs.** All Phase 0-5 artifacts in `.claude-audit/current/`.

**Outputs.**
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-config.json` — config findings.
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-asvs.jsonl` — ASVS checklist coverage
  per category (one line per ASVS sub-item where relevant).
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-api-top10.jsonl` — API Top 10 mapping
  per attack-surface row.
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-llm-top10.jsonl` — LLM Top 10 (if LLM
  usage detected; else empty).
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-web-top10.jsonl` — OWASP Top 10:2025
  (web) mapping, one row per A01..A10 (always written; roll-up).
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-agentic-top10.jsonl` — Agentic
  Applications 2026 coverage (if `mcp_agentic.detected`; else empty).
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-linddun.jsonl` — LINDDUN privacy review
  (if PII detected; else empty).
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-stride/<partition>.md` — STRIDE table
  per top-N partition.
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-06.done`

**Execution.** Single orchestrator pass for §6.1-6.7 (config). Fan-out
sub-agents for §6.8-6.12 (methodology spines) — one per methodology per
partition, 8 concurrent cap.

---

## 6.1 — CORS configuration

For each detected CORS setup (from `cors_config` keystone tags + Phase 0
data), verify:

| Rule | Severity if violated |
|---|---|
| `origin: "*"` with `credentials: true` | **CRITICAL** / CWE-346 |
| Wildcard origin on authenticated endpoints | **HIGH** |
| Origin validation via `.includes()` / partial match | **HIGH** (bypassable: `evil-example.com` contains `example.com`) |
| Overly permissive methods (PUT/DELETE when GET suffices) | **MEDIUM** |
| Overly permissive headers | **MEDIUM** |
| Missing `Vary: Origin` when origin is dynamic | **LOW** |

Emit one finding per partition where CORS lives. Tag: `category: config`,
`owasp_ids: ["ASVS-V14.5.1", "API8:2023"]`.

## 6.2 — Security headers

Per-partition, verify these headers are set (by the app, or by a
clearly-attached CDN/proxy). Required rubric:

| Header | Expected | Severity if missing |
|---|---|---|
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` (≥1 year) | **HIGH** / CWE-319 |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | **MEDIUM** |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` | **MEDIUM** |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Defined; `default-src 'self'` or stricter | **MEDIUM** |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or stricter | **LOW** |
| `Permissions-Policy` | Defined (camera, microphone, geolocation) | **LOW** |
| `X-XSS-Protection` | `0` (modern) or absent (legacy OK either way) | **INFO** |

Check sources in priority order: framework config (nuxt.config,
next.config, helmet(), Spring SecurityConfig, django.middleware.security),
reverse-proxy config (if detectable), HTML `<meta>` tags.

## 6.3 — Cookie security

For each cookie-setting call site (grep `setCookie|Set-Cookie|cookie.*options`):

| Attribute | Rule | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `httpOnly` | MUST be true for session/auth cookies | **HIGH** / CWE-1004 |
| `secure` | MUST be true in prod (or `secure: env === 'production'`) | **HIGH** / CWE-614 |
| `sameSite` | MUST be `Lax` or `Strict` (or `None` with explicit justification) | **HIGH** / CWE-1275 |
| expiry | Session cookies shouldn't exceed 30 days | **MEDIUM** |
| payload | Only session IDs; no PII / tokens in non-HttpOnly cookies | **HIGH** |

## 6.4 — Error handling & info disclosure

For production error paths (grep `stack.trace|err\.stack|createError|throw new Error|catch`):

- Stack traces returned in API responses → **HIGH** / CWE-209.
- Database errors leaked (table names, query syntax) → **HIGH** / CWE-209.
- Distinct 403 vs 404 for IDOR surfaces → **MEDIUM** / CWE-209.
- Debug endpoints accessible when `NODE_ENV != development` → **HIGH** /
  CWE-215.

Cross-reference the profile's deployment CI workflow — if `NODE_ENV` /
`DJANGO_DEBUG` / similar is set at CI but falls through in k8s
manifests, flag.

## 6.5 — Environment variable security

- `.env` / `.env.local` / `.env.production` tracked in git → **CRITICAL** /
  CWE-538 (cross-ref cat-06).
- Client-exposed env vars (`NUXT_PUBLIC_*`, `VITE_*`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)
  that contain secret-looking names → **HIGH**.
- Fallback default for secrets (`process.env.SECRET || 'default-secret'`)
  → **HIGH** / CWE-798.
- `runtimeConfig.public` (Nuxt) or equivalent containing secrets → **HIGH**.

## 6.6 — Rate limiting

Endpoints that SHOULD be rate-limited (from Phase 2 surface inventory):
- Login, register, password reset, 2FA verify, token create, webhook
  receivers, file upload.

Missing rate limit → **MEDIUM** / CWE-307 / CWE-770.

## 6.7 — Transport & outbound-client config

In addition to cat-04 (MITM) findings on outbound TLS clients:
- **Egress proxy** — is one configured? Presence or absence of
  `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` settings informs M4's SSRF recommendations.
- **IMDS blocking** — in cloud deployments, does the app block
  `169.254.169.254`? Check SSRF defenses centrally.
- **Mixed content** — HTTP endpoints served from HTTPS pages (if SSR
  templates or config show `http://` resource URLs).

## 6.8 — CI/CD configuration

From `profile.deployment.ci.*`:
- **GitHub Actions**: pinned actions (`uses: org/action@sha` not `@v1`),
  workflow-level `permissions:` block, no `pull_request_target` + PR
  head checkout, secrets only in non-fork workflows.
- **GitLab CI**: `protected:` on secret variables, `tags:` restrict
  secret-exposing jobs to trusted runners.
- **CircleCI / Buildkite**: similar — pin versions, scope secrets.

Cross-reference zizmor SARIF if present. Findings tagged
`category: deployment`, `owasp_ids: ["ASVS-V14.1", "API8:2023"]`.

## 6.9 — ASVS 5.0 Level 2 spine

Invoke the **Agent tool** once per ASVS L2 category (V1 through V17 —
17 sub-agents). For each category, the Agent invocation has:
- `description`: a short label like `"ASVS L2 V6 (Crypto)"`.
- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`.
- `prompt`: the ASVS L2 spec for that category (curated subset in
  `lib/asvs-l2.md`) plus a category-specific file seed
  (e.g. V6 Crypto → `lib/crypto-imports.md`).

Concurrency cap: 8 in flight (same window-dispatch procedure as
Phase 5 §5.2 Step B). Do NOT pass a `model` parameter — Claude Code
routes general-purpose sub-agents to the harness-appropriate Opus
variant automatically. Do NOT collapse the 17 categories into a
single summary pass — each sub-agent is doing targeted file inspection
against its category's required controls.

Each sub-agent appends JSONL rows to its own per-category file at
`.claude-audit/current/phase-06-asvs-<cat>.jsonl`. After all 17 return,
the orchestrator concatenates them into the canonical aggregate via
this **literal Bash command** (with a count check so a partial fan-out
fails loudly instead of producing a partial aggregate):

```bash
count=$(ls .claude-audit/current/phase-06-asvs-*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
if [ "$count" -ne 17 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: expected 17 ASVS per-category files, got $count — sub-agents failed or were not all dispatched" >&2
  exit 1
fi
cat .claude-audit/current/phase-06-asvs-*.jsonl \
  > .claude-audit/current/phase-06-asvs.jsonl
```

The `ls | wc -l` count is robust under both `nullglob` ON and OFF
(unlike a `set -- glob` test). Run via the Bash tool — do NOT re-write
the rows by reading them into context. Both the per-category files and
the concatenated aggregate are required outputs (see `manifest.yaml`).

Row shape (one JSON object per line):
```json
{"asvs_id":"V6.2.1","status":"PASS|FAIL|N/A","file":"...","line":0,"message":"...","severity":"..."}
```

Compute coverage percentage for the report at the end.

## 6.10 — API Top 10 (2023) mechanical mapping

For each HTTP/gRPC/GraphQL surface in Phase 2:
- API1 (BOLA) — cat-02 findings
- API2 (Broken Auth) — cat-01 findings
- API3 (BOPLA) — cat-02 mass-assignment rows
- API4 (Unrestricted Resource Consumption) — cat-09 (for LLM) + cat-01
  rate-limiting
- API5 (BFLA) — cat-01 admin-role findings
- API6 (Unrestricted Business Flow Access) — out-of-scope for automated
  detection; note as manual review item in report
- API7 (SSRF) — cat-08 SSRF findings
- API8 (Security Misconfiguration) — §6.1-6.8 above
- API9 (Improper Inventory Management) — out-of-scope (manual)
- API10 (Unsafe Consumption of APIs) — outbound_tls surfaces + cat-04

Emit `phase-06-api-top10.jsonl` with one line per API-* category
containing counts and pointers into the underlying findings.

## 6.11 — LLM Top 10 (2025) — conditional

If `profile.llm_usage.detected == false` or `kind == "internal"`,
write an empty `.claude-audit/current/phase-06-llm-top10.jsonl` (zero
bytes) — the empty file is the signal that the gate ran; do not omit it.

Otherwise, ALL cat-09 findings get aggregated here with additional
context mapping (system-prompt sources, tool-calling scope).

## 6.12 — LINDDUN — conditional

If `profile.pii.detected == false`, write an empty
`.claude-audit/current/phase-06-linddun.jsonl` (literally zero bytes)
and note the skip in the methodology coverage. The empty file is the
signal that the gate ran; do not omit the file.

If PII *is* detected, invoke the **Agent tool** once per
`(entity, threat)` pair, where threat is one of: Linkability,
Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure, Unawareness,
Non-compliance. Each Agent invocation has:
- `description`: a short label like `"LINDDUN Disclosure on User"`.
- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`.
- `prompt`: the LINDDUN threat definition for that threat plus the
  scope of `entity.pii_cols`.

Each sub-agent appends one JSONL row to
`.claude-audit/current/phase-06-linddun.jsonl` for its `(entity, threat)`
pair. Concurrency cap: 8. Do NOT pass a `model` parameter (per §6.9).

## 6.13 — STRIDE per surface

Invoke the **Agent tool** once per top-N partition. For each `p` in the
top-N partition list, the Agent invocation has:
- `description`: a short label like `"STRIDE table for services-api"`.
- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`.
- `prompt`: STRIDE methodology + `phase-02-surface.json` scoped to `p`,
  plus `profile.auth`, `profile.trust_zones`, plus the partition's
  Phase 5 `auth` and `idor` findings.

Each sub-agent writes its partition's Markdown table to
`.claude-audit/current/phase-06-stride/<p.id>.md`. Concurrency cap: 8.
Do NOT pass a `model` parameter (per §6.9). Do NOT summarize all
partitions' STRIDE into a single Markdown blob — the per-partition file
layout is how Phase 7 stitches partitions into the final report.

The STRIDE sub-agent reads:
- `phase-02-surface.json` scoped to the partition
- `profile.auth`, `profile.data_model`, `profile.trust_zones`
- Phase 5 `auth` and `idor` findings for the partition

Output Markdown, not JSONL (STRIDE is inherently tabular-narrative).

## 6.16 — OWASP Top 10:2025 (web) mechanical mapping

**Always runs** (no gate, no sub-agent fan-out) — this is a roll-up from
the CWE tags every finding already carries, mirroring the §6.10 API Top 10
pattern. Drive it off the lookup table in `lib/owasp-web-top10.md` (Part 1).

**Edition.** OWASP Top 10:2025 (web) — final (announced Nov 2025, final
text Jan 2026). Tag form `A##:2025` (e.g. `A03:2025`). The owasp_ids
pattern in `lib/finding-schema.json` already admits `A\d+:\d{4}`.

For each finding collected so far (Phase 5 deep-dives + §6.1-6.13), look
up `properties.cwe` in the `lib/owasp-web-top10.md` Part 1 table and assign
it to the **first** matching `A##:2025` category (A01→A10 order, so the
specific access-control / supply-chain buckets win ties — do not
double-count one finding into two A## categories). Key 2025 changes to
honour in the mapping:
- **SSRF (CWE-918) rolls up to A01** (Broken Access Control), not to A05
  Injection — this is the 2025 fold. Keep the finding's own
  `category: injection`; only the `A##:2025` roll-up changes.
- **A03 Software Supply Chain Failures** (NEW) draws from cat-10 supply-
  chain findings + scanner SBOM/dependency results (osv-scanner, trivy,
  grype). A `category: supply_chain` finding still rolls up to A03.
- **A02 Security Misconfiguration** is the §6.1-6.8 config bucket.
- **A10 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** (NEW) draws from §6.4
  error-handling findings.

Append the resolved `A##:2025` id to the finding's `owasp_ids[]` (additive;
never replace existing tags) and emit `phase-06-web-top10.jsonl` with one
row per A01..A10 containing counts and pointers into the underlying
findings. Keep the web Top 10 **and** the API Top 10 (§6.10) — both ship.

Row shape (one JSON object per line):
```json
{"web_top10_id":"A03:2025","name":"Software Supply Chain Failures","count":0,"finding_ids":[]}
```

Emit all 10 rows (A01..A10) even when a category's count is 0, so Phase 7's
coverage matrix can report which categories fired.

## 6.17 — Agentic Applications 2026 coverage lens — conditional

If `profile.mcp_agentic.detected != true`, write an empty
`.claude-audit/current/phase-06-agentic-top10.jsonl` (literally zero bytes)
and note the skip in the methodology coverage. The empty file is the signal
that the gate ran; do not omit it. This gate **mirrors how §6.11 LLM Top 10
is gated on `llm_usage`** — except it keys on `mcp_agentic` (tool-calling /
MCP surface), which is a distinct surface that the LLM gate would wrongly
skip.

If `mcp_agentic.detected == true`, this is a **spine-level coverage view**,
NOT new analysis: `steps/deepdive/cat-11-mcp-agentic.md` already emits
per-finding `ASI##:2026` tags during its fan-out. Here, roll those cat-11
findings up by ASI tag into an ASI01..ASI10 coverage matrix, using the list
in `lib/owasp-agentic-2026.md`. No sub-agent fan-out (cat-11 already did it).

**Edition.** OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026 — published
2025-12-09; **complementary to** the LLM Top 10 2025. LLM tags stay
`LLM##:2025`; agentic tags are `ASI##:2026` (e.g. `ASI01:2026`). The
owasp_ids pattern already admits `ASI\d+:\d{4}`.

Emit `phase-06-agentic-top10.jsonl`, one row per ASI01..ASI10:
```json
{"agentic_id":"ASI01:2026","name":"Agent Goal Hijack","count":0,"finding_ids":[]}
```

## 6.18 — NIST SSDF (SP 800-218 v1.1) repo meta-check

Repo-metadata-level assertions (NOT per-finding). Cite **NIST SP 800-218
v1.1 (Feb 2022)** explicitly. Assert presence of:
- (PO/RV) a documented vuln-disclosure / `SECURITY.md`.
- (PS/PW) dependency-pinning + SBOM generation in CI.
- (PS.2) signed releases / build provenance.
- (PW.7 / PW.8) automated SAST + secret-scanning in CI.

**When `profile.llm_usage.detected == true` OR `profile.mcp_agentic.detected
== true`**, ADD the **SP 800-218A** assertions — the *Generative-AI / dual-
use SSDF Community Profile*, **final July 2024** (an extension of 800-218,
not a replacement). These are repo-metadata-level meta-checks relevant to
AI components, reported as a meta-check section (not per-finding):
- training-data provenance documented (source, license, integrity);
- model-artifact integrity (checksums / signatures for shipped weights;
  cross-ref cat-10 / cat-11 model-deserialization findings);
- model-supply-chain documentation (which hubs / base models, pinned
  revisions, `trust_remote_code` posture).

Record the SSDF + (conditional) 800-218A results inside `phase-06-config.json`
under an `ssdf` key; surface them in the Phase 7 report's coverage section.

## 6.19 — Authorized-Egress Reconciliation (the cross-layer / missing-enforcer pass)

**Always runs. This is the pass that catches the control-with-no-enforcer /
confused-deputy / capability-URL class** (the deck-2FA bug) — the class that
per-partition, per-handler deep-dives structurally cannot see, because the
credential's writer and the resource's byte-serving sink live in different
partitions and each looks locally fine. Inputs: the GLOBAL `phase-02-sinks.json`
+ `phase-02-credentials.json` + `phase-02-surface.json` + `phase-00-profile.json`.

### Step 1 — deterministic reconciliation + fail-closed coverage gate

Load `SKILL_DIR=$(cat .claude-audit/.skill-dir)` and run:

```bash
SKILL_DIR=$(cat .claude-audit/.skill-dir)
[ -n "$SKILL_DIR" ] || { echo "ERROR: SKILL_DIR not resolved"; exit 1; }
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/lib/validate-egress.py" \
  .claude-audit/current/phase-02-sinks.json \
  .claude-audit/current/phase-02-credentials.json \
  .claude-audit/current/phase-02-surface.json \
  .claude-audit/current/phase-00-profile.json \
  --source-root . \
  --partition global \
  --out .claude-audit/current/phase-06-egress.jsonl \
  || { echo "phase-06 §6.19 FAILED (coverage gate or HIGH+ deficit) — resolve before advancing" >&2; exit 1; }
```

The script (a) re-extracts egress candidates from source and **FAILS the run if
any candidate sink/credential site was neither inventoried nor dismissed in
Phase 2** (fail-closed coverage, **line-scoped** — a sink at one line cannot mask
an un-inventoried sink elsewhere in the same file), and (b) emits one finding per
gate-deficit via rules R2-R5:

- **R2** — R served by ≥2 sinks with differing min-branch gates ⇒ the weaker is a deficit (CWE-862).
- **R3** — a byte-serving branch that is ungated / gated only by "identifier known" on a sensitive R (CWE-639/441).
- **R4** — a credential minted (writers≠∅) but with **zero readers anywhere** — pure theatre (CWE-862). (Reader-based, NOT substring — a credential consumed in middleware is correctly NOT flagged.)
- **R5** — R's strongest gate sits only on a resolve/identify surface (not a byte sink) ⇒ flag every byte-serving sink for R (CWE-862). **This is the deck-2FA rule.**

> **How gates are ranked (controlled, negation-aware).** `enforced_gate` /
> `intended_gate` free text is ranked NONE < AUTHN < AUTHZ < VERIFIED by keyword,
> but **negation dominates**: a description of an *absent* control ("no role
> check", "unauthenticated", "missing ownership") ranks NONE even though it
> contains positive keywords. Unrecognized text also ranks NONE. The failure
> direction is deliberately conservative — an ambiguous gate is treated as **no
> gate**, so the tool over-flags (triaged) rather than misses. A credential that
> protects R raises R's gate floor, so an ungated byte path to R is caught as a
> deficit (R5/R2) — this replaces the unsound v2.4-draft "R1" substring-
> consumption check, which false-positived on credentials enforced in middleware.

If the coverage gate fails, go back to Phase 2 §2.11 and account for the missing
candidates; do not proceed with an incomplete egress inventory. If
`phase-02-sinks.json` has no sinks, write a zero-byte `phase-06-egress.jsonl`.

### Step 2 — adversarial confirmation (attack, don't summarize)

For each deficit finding the reconciliation emitted, invoke the **Agent tool**
(concurrency cap 8) per `(resource, sink)` with a task that is an **attack, not a
review** — this operationalizes RCA §11 ("show me the request that should
fail"):

- `description`: `"Egress probe: <resource> via <sink_id>"`.
- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`. Do NOT pass a `model` parameter.
- `prompt`: *"Here is a candidate unauthorized-access path: sink `<sink_file>`
  branch `<branch_id>` serves `<resource>` bytes with gate `<enforced_gate>`,
  while the resource's intended gate is `<floor_src>`. **Construct the exact
  unauthenticated / under-authorized request that returns `<resource>`'s bytes,
  or prove it is impossible** by tracing the real middleware/branch order from
  entry to bytes. Read the actual handler + every middleware in its chain — do
  NOT trust the inventory's summary. Return the `verification_probe` (the curl an
  attacker runs + the expected denial), set `actual` if you can statically
  determine the live result, and a confidence: CONFIRMED if you produced a
  concrete bypass request, REFUTED if you proved the gate holds on every path
  (with the line that enforces it)."*

Merge each confirmation back into `phase-06-egress.jsonl`: promote to
`confidence: CONFIRMED` + attach the `verification_probe` when the sub-agent
constructs a bypass; **demote/drop** the finding (record as INFO with the
refuting line) when it proves the gate holds. This adversarial pass is what
turns "the inventory says weak" into "here is the request that proves it".

> Honest framing (carries into the report): a clean §6.19 means every *known*
> egress candidate was accounted for and gated — it is high-signal but **NOT a
> proof of absence**. CDN-edge egress with no code path, and any modality outside
> `lib/egress-detection.md`, remain out of mechanical reach and are surfaced as
> report caveats, never silently.

## 6.20 — Collection-Scoping Reconciliation (v2.5)

**Always runs.** §6.19 asks whether every path that emits a resource's *bytes* is
gated. This asks a different question that §6.19 structurally cannot: **does the
query bind rows to the caller?** The handler that motivated this returns JSON, so
it never entered the sink inventory at all; and its gate *is* consumed — just at
the wrong granularity.

### Step 1 — deterministic reconciliation + fail-closed coverage gate

```bash
SKILL_DIR=$(cat .claude-audit/.skill-dir)
[ -n "$SKILL_DIR" ] || { echo "ERROR: SKILL_DIR not resolved"; exit 1; }
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/lib/validate-collection-scoping.py" \
  .claude-audit/current/phase-02-collections.json \
  .claude-audit/current/phase-00-profile.json \
  .claude-audit/current/phase-02-surface.json \
  --source-root . \
  --partition global \
  --out .claude-audit/current/phase-06-collections.jsonl \
  || { echo "phase-06 §6.20 FAILED (coverage gate or HIGH+ deficit) — resolve before advancing" >&2; exit 1; }
```

The script (a) re-extracts list-query candidates from the handler files and
**FAILS the run if any candidate was neither inventoried nor dismissed** in Phase
2 §2.12 (line-scoped, same discipline as §6.19), and (b) emits one finding per
scoping deficit via rules C1-C5:

- **C1** — a collection of a sensitive entity with no caller-bound predicate,
  no filtering visibility helper, and no `public_resources` entry (CWE-1220).
  `role_restricted` counts as unscoped unless the role is admin-tier.
  **This is the primary rule.**
- **C2** — authorization by decoration: a per-row permission computed and
  attached rather than applied (CWE-863). Write-permission decoration on a
  collection that was never read-filtered is a finding by construction.
- **C3** — `coverage: incomplete|caveat`: a fail-closed deficit, surfaced as an
  open question rather than a silent pass.
- **C4** — a sibling **test** that asserts another principal's row is *present*
  (rather than absent/404), especially with a permission field asserted false.
  High-signal because someone wrote it deliberately: the insecure behaviour is
  encoded as the expected behaviour, so a correct fix will look like a broken
  test.
- **C5** — a `caller_bound`/`visibility_filtered` claim whose `scope_evidence`
  predicate references no session/user/tenant/org value. The row is rewritten to
  `unscoped` and C1 then fires. **The inventory cannot launder a false claim.**

The `|| { ...; exit 1; }` guard is not decoration. Without it the only thing
stopping the run is prose telling the orchestrator to stop, and an orchestrator
that reads a wall of `!` lines and continues anyway turns a "fail-closed" gate
into a suggestion. The shell exit is the part that does not depend on the model
being conscientious.

If the coverage gate fails, return to Phase 2 §2.12 and account for the missing
candidates. Do not proceed on an incomplete inventory.

### Step 2 — adversarial confirmation (attack, don't summarize)

For each C1/C2 deficit, invoke the **Agent tool** (concurrency cap 8) per
`(handler, entity)` with a task that is an attack, not a review:

- `description`: `"Collection probe: <entity> via <handler_file>"`.
- `subagent_type`: `"general-purpose"`. Do NOT pass a `model` parameter.
- `prompt`: *"Handler `<handler_file>` returns a list of `<entity>` and the
  reconciliation says its rows are not bound to the caller (`<row_scope>`,
  gate `<endpoint_gate>`). **Trace the query from construction to response and
  either (a) produce the concrete request that returns another principal's rows,
  or (b) prove every row is scoped** by naming the file:line of the predicate —
  including any base scope, default_scope, tenant-injecting repository, ORM
  client extension, or database row-level-security policy. Read the actual query
  builder; do NOT trust the inventory's summary. Return the
  `verification_probe` (the request an attacker runs + the expected denial) and
  a confidence: CONFIRMED if you produced a cross-principal read, REFUTED if you
  found the scope."*

Merge each result back into `phase-06-collections.jsonl`: promote to
`CONFIRMED` with the probe when the sub-agent constructs a cross-principal read;
**demote to INFO with the refuting line** when it finds the base scope. Missing a
base scope is this rule's main false-positive mode, and this pass is what
retires it.

> Honest framing (carries into the report): a clean §6.20 means every *known*
> list-query candidate was accounted for and scoped. It is high-signal but
> **NOT a proof of absence** — a scope applied by an un-modelled mechanism can

## 6.14 — Emit

Run §6.16-6.20 (web Top 10 roll-up, agentic coverage lens, SSDF meta-check,
Authorized-Egress reconciliation, collection-scoping reconciliation) after the
§6.1-6.13 work, then write all JSONL files (including
`phase-06-web-top10.jsonl`, `phase-06-agentic-top10.jsonl`,
`phase-06-egress.jsonl`, and `phase-06-collections.jsonl`), the STRIDE Markdown
files, and `phase-06-config.json` (the §6.1-6.8 config findings plus the §6.18
`ssdf` meta-check block, in structured form). Write `phase-06.done`.

## 6.15 — Report to user

> Phase 6 complete — ASVS coverage: <X%> passed, <Y%> failed, <Z%> N/A.
> API Top 10 mapping: <count> findings across <N> categories. Web Top
> 10:2025: <K> of 10 categories fired. <LLM/Agentic/LINDDUN status>.
> STRIDE tables written for <K> partitions. Proceeding to Phase 7.

## Verify before exit (MANDATORY)

Before declaring this phase complete and proceeding, run:

```bash
test -f .claude-audit/current/phase-06-config.json  \
  && test -f .claude-audit/current/phase-06-egress.jsonl \
  && test -f .claude-audit/current/phase-06-collections.jsonl \
  && test -f .claude-audit/current/phase-06.done \
  && echo "phase-06 verified" \
  || { echo "phase-06 INCOMPLETE — re-write artifact(s) + .done marker before proceeding" >&2; exit 1; }
```

Do not advance to the next phase until this check prints "phase-06 verified". Producing only a downstream artifact (e.g. the final report) without the per-phase artifact + marker is an INVALID run.
