# Phase 8 — Baseline Persistence

## 🛑 MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

📋 **This phase MUST produce, on disk, before exit (full-mode only):**
- `.claude-audit/baseline.json` (full baseline; gitignored)
- `<output_dir>/security-audit-baseline.json` (pruned baseline; checked in)
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-08.done`

⛔ **SKIP Phase 8 ONLY IF** mode=delta OR `phase-07.done` is absent OR `audit.log` has CRITICAL runtime errors (`findings` CRITICAL-severity is fine and expected — that's the audit's job; the gate is on runtime errors, not findings severity) OR **the §7.15 severity gate reports unresolved governance failures** (v2.5 — see §8.1 gate 4).

📖 In full mode, without a baseline, **delta mode is permanently unavailable to the user**. Skipping Phase 8 when it shouldn't be skipped silently eliminates the sub-minute incremental re-audit capability.

---

**Goal.** After a successful full audit, write a baseline JSON that future
`mode: delta` runs can diff against for sub-minute incremental audits.

**Inputs.** All Phase 0-7 artifacts in `.claude-audit/current/`.

**Outputs.**
- `.claude-audit/baseline.json` — full baseline (gitignored, detailed).
- `<output_dir>/security-audit-baseline.json` — pruned baseline (checked in).
- `.claude-audit/history/<ISO-timestamp>/` — previous `current/` archived
  (rotation happens at the next run's preflight, not here).
- `.claude-audit/current/phase-08.done`

**Execution.** Single orchestrator pass. No sub-agents.

---

## 8.1 — When Phase 8 runs

Phase 8 runs **only if**:
1. `mode == "full"` (delta mode re-uses an existing baseline; it does not
   overwrite it unless the user passes `--refresh-baseline`).
2. Phase 7 completed successfully (`phase-07.done` exists).
3. No hard errors (gate: count of CRITICAL runtime errors in audit.log
   must be zero; findings CRITICAL-severity is fine and expected).
4. **The §7.15 severity gate has no unresolved governance failures** (v2.5):

   ```bash
   blocking=$(jq -r '.governance_blocking // 0' \
     .claude-audit/current/phase-07-severity-gate.json 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
   if [ "$blocking" -gt 0 ]; then
     echo "Phase 8 SKIPPED — $blocking unresolved governance failure(s) (R4/L1-L3)."
     echo "The existing baseline is left untouched deliberately."
     exit 0
   fi
   ```

   **This is the load-bearing gate, not a formality.** R4 forbids a severity
   downgrade with no recorded reason — but that rule is worthless if a run
   carrying an unexplained downgrade is allowed to *persist itself as the new
   baseline*, because the next run would then have nothing to compare against
   and the downgrade becomes the truth. Refusing to write a baseline is what
   makes the ratchet a ratchet: **you cannot launder a downgrade by re-running
   the audit.** The remedy is to record the reason (or fix the finding), not to
   re-run until it goes quiet.

If any gate fails, skip Phase 8 and note in `notes[]`. The existing
baseline (if any) stays untouched.

## 8.2 — Baseline schema

Per `lib/baseline-schema.json`. The shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "audit_id": "...",
  "skill_version": "2.0.2",
  "git_head": "abc123def",
  "git_branch": "main",
  "created_at": "ISO-8601",
  "repo_topology": { "kind": "...", "tool": null, "partitions": [...]},
  "partition_manifest": {...},                 // copied from partitions.json (pruned)
  "surface": [...],                             // array of surface rows (pruned — id, file, handler_hash, auth_required, trust_zone only)
  "keystone_files": [...],                      // array of paths + reasons
  "auth_matrix": [...],                         // per (role, surface) allow/deny derived from cat-01 sub-agent output
  "idor_candidates": [...],                     // from cat-02 candidates (regardless of finding status)
  "config": {                                   // from phase-06-config.json
    "cors_origins": [...],
    "csp": "...",
    "cookie_flags": {...},
    "security_headers": {...}
  },
  "findings_carryover": [...],                  // findings from phase-07 tagged with their fingerprint — delta mode brings them forward unless invalidated
  "scanner_versions": {                         // provenance
    "semgrep": "1.82.0",
    "osv-scanner": "1.9.2",
    "gitleaks": "8.21.2",
    ...
  },
  "methodology_coverage": {                     // summary from phase-07
    "asvs_pct": 78.4,
    "api_top10_counts": {...},
    ...
  },
  "ignored": [...]                               // .claude-audit/ignore.txt contents
}
```

## 8.3 — Two files, two audiences

### `.claude-audit/baseline.json` (full)

Gitignored. Contains **all** findings with full descriptions, attack
scenarios, suggested fixes. Delta mode reads this to restore context
cheaply without re-running Phase 5.

### `<output_dir>/security-audit-baseline.json` (pruned, checked in)

Committed to the user's repo. Keeps only:
- `schema_version`, `skill_version`, `audit_id`
- `git_head`, `created_at`
- `partition_manifest` (id, path, risk, depth only)
- `surface` (id, file, handler_hash — no full params, no notes)
- `keystone_files` (paths + reason-count only)
- `findings_carryover`: finding fingerprints + titles + severities, with no body
  and no attack scenarios (users who want the full text read the full baseline).
  **Keep these fields regardless of pruning** (v2.5):
  - `cwe`, `category`, `line` — the next run recomputes fingerprints as
    `sha1(file:line:cwe:category)` and falls back to a `(file, cwe)` line-drift
    match when a finding moves. Prune these and R4 misses a downgrade every time
    someone adds an import above the handler.
  - `first_seen_at`, `severity_history[]`, `severity_asserted` /
    `severity_computed`, `lifecycle` — the ratchet's memory.

  Prune the prose, never the provenance. A pruned baseline without these makes
  R4 and L1 inert on the next run, which is the failure mode they exist to
  prevent.
- `methodology_coverage`
- `ignored`

Size target: ≤100KB for a 100K-LOC repo baseline. The full file can be
multi-MB; the pruned file is lightweight enough to diff in PRs.

## 8.4 — Write procedure

0. **Carry the lifecycle forward (v2.5) — do this FIRST, and never reset it.**
   For every finding entering `findings_carryover`, match it to the previous
   baseline by `fingerprint` and copy forward:
   - `first_seen_at` — the timestamp of the run that **first** reported this
     fingerprint. If the previous baseline has one, copy it verbatim. Only when
     there is no prior match do you set it to this run's `created_at`.
     **Resetting `first_seen_at` on an existing finding silently zeroes its age
     and disables the L1 gate** — that single field is the difference between
     "found this morning" and "open for 96 days".
   - `severity_history[]` — append-only. Concatenate the prior baseline's
     entries with any added this run; never truncate or rewrite.
   - `lifecycle` — carry `state`, `owner`, `expiry`, `rationale`, `fix_commit`,
     `verified_by_test` forward unless this run has newer information.
   Also record `severity_asserted` and `severity_computed` alongside `severity`
   so the next run's R4 check compares like with like.
1. Read all inputs listed above.
2. Assemble the full baseline struct in memory.
3. Validate against `lib/baseline-schema.json` (re-read your JSON).
4. Write `.claude-audit/baseline.json`.
5. Produce the pruned form by walking the full struct and copying only
   the fields listed in §8.3.
6. Resolve `<output_dir>` from `.claude-audit/config.json` (default
   `docs/security-audit-output/`, see [../lib/output-routing.md](../lib/output-routing.md))
   and ensure it exists:
   `OUT=$(jq -r '.output_dir // "docs/security-audit-output"' .claude-audit/config.json 2>/dev/null || echo docs/security-audit-output); mkdir -p "$OUT"`.
7. Write the pruned baseline to `$OUT/security-audit-baseline.json`.
8. Write `.claude-audit/current/phase-08.done`.

## 8.5 — Rotation of previous runs

Phase 8 does NOT rotate history. Rotation happens at the **next** run's
preflight (`workflow.md §1.2`). The ordering is:
- Run N completes → baseline.json written.
- Run N+1 starts → preflight sees existing `current/`, moves it to
  `history/<N's created_at>/`, then starts N+1's new `current/`.

This way, if a user aborts Phase 8 or the process crashes mid-write, the
previous run is still intact under `history/`.

## 8.6 — Delta-mode lifecycle reference

(Reminder of how the baseline is consumed — full procedure in
`workflow.md §4 "mode: delta"`.)

1. `mode: delta` requires `<output_dir>/security-audit-baseline.json`.
2. Preflight computes `git diff --name-only <baseline.git_head> HEAD`
   (the set of changed files).
3. Invalidation rules (`docs/V2-SCOPE.md §5`):
   - A surface row is **stale** if its `file ∈ ChangedFiles` OR its
     current `handler_hash` ≠ baseline's.
   - A partition is **stale-whole** if >20% of its files changed OR its
     manifest changed (package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.).
   - Any change to a keystone file invalidates every auth_matrix row.
   - Any change under `config/`, `*.config.*`, framework-specific config
     files re-runs Phase 6 in full.
   - Any lockfile change re-runs Phase 4 in full.
4. Phases 2-7 run ONLY on touched partitions + their adjacent
   partitions (where "adjacent" means shares a keystone file with a
   touched partition).
5. Non-touched findings carry forward with `source: baseline` appended
   and `confidence: unchanged`.

## 8.7 — Staleness threshold

If the baseline is older than **90 days**, delta mode **refuses** to
run and the skill falls back to full mode with a clear message:

> Baseline dated 2025-12-01 is >90 days old. Delta mode would miss
> ecosystem CVE updates. Running full audit — Phase 8 will refresh
> the baseline at the end.

This is a floor, not a policy — users can override with
`--force-stale-baseline`. The rationale is that OSV / gitleaks rule
updates land continuously; 90 days is the conservative outer bound.

## 8.8 — Report to user

> Phase 8 complete — baseline written.
>   - Full: `.claude-audit/baseline.json` ({{full_size}})
>   - Pruned (check in): `<output_dir>/security-audit-baseline.json` ({{pruned_size}})
>
> Future runs: `/security-audit mode: delta` to re-audit only changed
> surfaces (typical <5 min after baseline exists).

## 8.9 — Edge cases

- **First run** — no baseline exists. Phase 8 writes both files
  normally; next run can use `mode: delta`.
- **Dirty git tree** — phase-00 captured `git.dirty == true`.
  Baseline records this, and delta-mode compares against the baseline's
  git_head (not dirty-vs-dirty). A user who commits after a dirty-tree
  audit still gets a valid delta — the invalidation is slightly
  noisier (every changed file triggers a re-analyze) but correct.
- **Branch switch between runs** — delta-mode still works; it compares
  against the baseline's `git_head` regardless of current branch. The
  only requirement is that the baseline's commit is reachable via
  `git merge-base`.
- **Shallow clone** — baseline records the shallow state; delta-mode
  warns if `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` returns true AND
  the baseline's git_head isn't in the local history.

## Verify before exit (MANDATORY)

Before declaring this phase complete and proceeding, run:

```bash
test -f .claude-audit/current/../baseline.json # (plus pruned <output_dir>/security-audit-baseline.json) \
  && test -f .claude-audit/current/phase-08.done \
  && echo "phase-08 verified" \
  || { echo "phase-08 INCOMPLETE — re-write artifact + .done marker before proceeding" >&2; exit 1; }
```

Do not advance to the next phase until this check prints "phase-08 verified". Producing only a downstream artifact (e.g. the final report) without the per-phase artifact + marker is an INVALID run.
