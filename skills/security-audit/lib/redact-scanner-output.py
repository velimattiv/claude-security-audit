redact-scanner-output.py — strip credential material from scanner output at
ingest, before anything else in the pipeline reads it.

WHERE THIS RUNS
---------------
`steps/phase-04-scanners.md §4.4b`, immediately after each scanner writes its
report and BEFORE §4.5 normalization, §4.6 slimming, or any sub-agent read.
Run it against the whole scanner directory:

    python3 "$SKILL_DIR/lib/redact-scanner-output.py" \
        .claude-audit/current/phase-04-scanners/

WHY AT INGEST AND NOT AT THE WRITE BOUNDARY
-------------------------------------------
The v2.6.0 leak was found late and the obvious patch is a scrubber in front of
the `cp` in `phase-07-synthesis.md §7.10`. That is the wrong primary layer for
two reasons:

  * Raw secrets would still be written to disk, still be handed to deep-dive
    sub-agents as context, and still sit in `.claude-audit/history/<ts>/` after
    the run. The blast radius would shrink, not close.
  * It makes a pattern blocklist the only control, and a blocklist racing
    gitleaks' ~170 detectors loses. Whatever gitleaks detects and this table
    does not is a secret that survives to the deliverable.

This script does not pattern-match for the primary strip. It removes SARIF
`snippet` / `contents` / `insertedContent` — the ArtifactContent objects that
carry raw file text — from EVERY scanner run unconditionally. That is a
whitelist: nothing survives because the field is gone, regardless of which
detector fired or whether this skill has ever heard of the credential format.

The strip is free because no consumer in this skill reads those fields:

  * `lib/sarif-postprocess.md` slim schema keeps rule/level/file/line/message
    and explicitly discards the rest.
  * Phases 5-7 read the slim form.
  * `tests/e2e/assertions.py:_sarif_result_to_finding` extracts from `ruleId`,
    `properties.cwe`, `properties.cwes` and `tags`.
  * GitHub's Security tab renders the region from file+line, not from snippet.

What triage actually loses is the ability to eyeball the matched string. It
gets `properties.secret_fingerprint` instead — stable across runs, so a secret
finding still dedupes in Phase 7 and still carries forward in the Phase 8
baseline, with nothing spendable in the file.

Pattern scrubbing (`lib/secret-detectors.py`) runs afterwards as a second pass
over free text — scanner `message.text`, invocation command lines, trufflehog
`ExtraData` — which is the residue the structural strip cannot reach.

    # produced.

    # remediation pass aimed at audit outputs also rewrote SOURCE copies of a
    # project, replacing localhost dev connection strings that trufflehog had
    # reported as `Raw` values. Those were not credentials, the edit was not
    # wanted, and it had to be restored from git. An in-place scrubber pointed
    # at the wrong directory is a destructive tool, and "I passed the right path
    # last time" is not a control.
