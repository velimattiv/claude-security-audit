verify-deliverable.py — fail-closed gate on everything this skill writes into
the audited repository.

WHERE THIS RUNS
---------------
  * `steps/phase-07-synthesis.md §7.10` — before the `cp` of the report, SARIF
    and CycloneDX into `<output_dir>`.
  * `steps/phase-08-baseline.md §8.5` — before the pruned baseline `cp`.

    python3 "$SKILL_DIR/lib/verify-deliverable.py" --redact \
        --json-report .claude-audit/current/deliverable-gate.json \
        .claude-audit/current/phase-07-report.md \
        .claude-audit/current/findings.sarif \
        .claude-audit/current/findings.cyclonedx.json

WHY A SECOND LAYER EXISTS AT ALL
--------------------------------
`lib/redact-scanner-output.py` already strips scanner output structurally at
Phase 4 ingest, and that is the control that actually closes the v2.6.0 leak.
This gate is not a substitute for it. It exists because the structural strip
covers exactly one source — scanner reports — and the deliverables have a
second source the strip can never reach: **prose an analyst wrote.**

`steps/deepdive/cat-06-secret-sprawl.md` hands a sub-agent regexes for locating
literal credentials, and `lib/report-template.md` prints `{{description}}` and
`{{attack_scenario}}` verbatim into a tracked markdown file. Nothing before
v2.6.1 stopped an analyst from pasting the matched value into the finding it
was reporting. A structural strip cannot help there: the field is free text and
the whole point of it is to be read.

So the layering is deliberate and the asymmetry is deliberate:

  * Phase 4 strip — whitelist, no detector list, cannot lose coverage.
  * This gate  — blocklist, incomplete by construction, catches prose.

A blocklist as the *only* control would be a coverage claim this table cannot
support. A blocklist as the *last* control is a tripwire, and a tripwire that
fires is a bug report.

WHY IT REDACTS RATHER THAN ABORTS
---------------------------------
Aborting the write is strictly safer and was rejected on the grounds that a
user three phases into a 45-minute audit will reach for whatever flag makes the
abort go away, and that flag then becomes the hole. Instead the gate scrubs,
writes, and forces a CRITICAL finding into the report (`--json-report` feeds
`phase-07-synthesis.md §7.10a`) that names this as a defect in the audit tool
rather than in the audited code. The user still gets their deliverables; the
failure is impossible to mistake for a finding about their own repository.

A firing gate means the Phase 4 strip did not hold. That is worth a bug report
upstream, and the emitted finding says so.

EXIT CODES
----------
  0  clean — nothing to redact
  1  `--check`: credential material present (nothing written)
  2  usage or I/O error
  3  `--redact`: material was found and scrubbed; caller MUST emit the
     CRITICAL self-finding described in §7.10a
