compose-attack-paths.py — Phase-7 severity gate (v2.6).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
2026-03-15 audit, finding M6, confidence CONFIRMED, filed MEDIUM:

    "...build-output bypasses that if the deck UUID is known.
     Combined with H1, an attacker can identify published decks and
     access output directly."

H1 — "GET /api/decks returns ALL decks (including private) to any authenticated
reader — enables enumeration" — was a **HIGH in the same document**, supplying
exactly the capability M6's mitigation ("if the UUID is known") assumed nobody
had. M6 stayed unremediated for 96 days, was downgraded to LOW at the next
baseline, and the sibling endpoint was affirmatively described as
"well-defended (INFO)". Total exposure >= 103 days.

Chain DETECTION was not the failure. The chain was written down, in prose, by a
human, in the finding's own description. Chain ARITHMETIC was the failure:
severity was assigned by category and instinct, and nothing in the methodology
gave that sentence power over the rating.

So the control is not "detect more chains". It is: **make severity a computed
function of the attack path that prose cannot contradict, and make a silent
downgrade across runs impossible.**

MODEL
-----
Every finding declares (lib/capability-lexicon.md):
  preconditions  — capabilities an attacker must already hold
  postconditions — capabilities the finding grants
Paths start from attacker PERSONAS. A finding joins a path when its
preconditions are satisfied by the persona plus everything already traversed.

RULES (each maps to an observed real-world failure)
  R1 UNDISCHARGED-MITIGATION  A finding whose precondition is supplied by another
     finding's postcondition may not treat that precondition as mitigating.
     Severity floor = the supplying finding's severity. Applied to a fixpoint so
     multi-hop chains propagate.                                        (M6/H1)
  R2 PROSE-REFERENCES-CHAIN   A finding whose text says "combined with X" and
     names another finding must be >= that finding's severity. Five lines of
     regex that ALONE would have escalated M6 in March.
  R3 CROWN-JEWEL-REACHED      Any path from an UNPRIVILEGED persona that reaches
     a crown-jewel capability is CRITICAL — but only for the findings that
     actually CONTRIBUTE to reaching it (backward slice), not every finding that
     happens to be reachable. This is the precision fix over the reference
     implementation, which escalated bystanders too.
     R3 is UNCAPPED and deliberately so: it is a distinct mechanism from §7.4's
     ±1 context-signal nudge, and the founding case (M6 above) only works if a
     MEDIUM can reach CRITICAL in one step. v2.6 gates it on evidence instead:
     a contributing member declared `structurally_unreachable` WITH a cite
     suppresses the escalation, and the suppression is reported loudly.
     (v2.6) Rows carrying `annexed_to` — mechanical enumeration legs folded into
     a judgement finding, Wave 2b — are excluded from the graph entirely, which
     is where 47% of the calibrated run's capability tags came from.
  R4 SEVERITY-RATCHET         Severity may never decrease across runs without a
     recorded reason naming what changed (fix commit / compensating control /
     disproven exploitability / rescope). A downgrade with no reason FAILS the
     run. A finding that DISAPPEARS unexplained is itself a finding.
                              (CONFIRMED-MEDIUM -> LOW -> "well-defended")

LIFECYCLE GATES (R1-R4 fix the rating; these force the action)
  L1 AGE          A CONFIRMED HIGH/CRITICAL older than --max-age-days with no
     linked fix commit and no unexpired acceptance FAILS the run. This is the
     gate that closes the 96-day hole.
  L2 ACCEPTANCE   HIGH+ cannot be closed as `accepted` without a named owner AND
     an expiry date; an expired acceptance is not an acceptance.
  L3 CLOSURE      `verified` requires a regression test id. `fixed` without one
     is reported: in the historical case the fix shipped with no denial test and
     a sibling test mocked the very gate it should have pinned, so "fixed" was
     never mechanically proven — which is why the class recurred on a different
     endpoint.

Usage:
  python3 compose-attack-paths.py <findings.jsonl ...> \
      [--profile phase-00-profile.json] [--baseline baseline.json] \
      [--changed-files changed.txt] [--run-id RID] [--now ISO8601] \
      [--max-age-days 30] [--strict-closure] \
      [--out governance.jsonl] [--rewrite corrected.jsonl] \
      [--json-summary summary.json] [--quiet]
  python3 compose-attack-paths.py --print-contract
      Print the severity contract and exit 0. tests/test-attack-paths.sh diffs
      this against the `severity-contract` block in steps/phase-07-synthesis.md,
      so the prose and the arithmetic agree by assertion rather than by reading.

Exit codes:
  0  clean — no escalation required, no governance failure
  1  escalations required OR a governance gate failed (blocks publication of a
     clean bill; Phase 7 must apply --rewrite and re-run to convergence, and
     Phase 8 must not write a baseline while governance failures stand)

# --- R3 escalation contract (v2.6, story 1.4) -------------------------------
#
# The prose in steps/phase-07-synthesis.md §7.4 caps context-signal adjustment
# at ±1 rung "regardless of how many triggers fire". v2.5 shipped that sentence
# next to a composer that sets CRITICAL outright, and a reader calibrating on
# §7.4 therefore mis-read every composed severity.
#
# THE CODE IS RIGHT AND THE PROSE WAS WRONG. These are two mechanisms:
#
#   §7.4  context signals (trust_zone, data_ops, evidence_class) — a calibration
#         nudge over ONE finding read in isolation. Capped at ±1, because the
#         severity was already set by the rubric and context only corroborates.
#   R3    chain composition — a claim about a PATH, not a nudge. The founding
#         case was a MEDIUM whose mitigation ("only if the UUID is known") was
#         discharged by a HIGH in the same document. Cap R3 at one rung and that
#         finding becomes HIGH, which is exactly the rating that let it rot for
#         96 days. Capping the composer kills the thesis.
#
# So R3 stays uncapped and is gated on EVIDENCE instead. The measured defect it
# has to answer for: a dev-mode finding asserted LOW and computed CRITICAL on a
# genuine chain, whose `isDemoCapableEnv` allowlists only {local, sandbox} with
# a fail-closed `unknown` default — structurally unreachable in dev, staging and
# production. The analyst who rated it LOW already knew that. The information
# existed and had no channel to reach the composer. `deployment_reachability` is
# that channel.
#
# These constants ARE the contract: `--print-contract` prints them, and
# tests/test-attack-paths.sh diffs that output against the fenced
# `severity-contract` block in steps/phase-07-synthesis.md. Prose and behaviour
# agree because a test says so, not because someone read both.
