validate-egress.py — Authorized-Egress reconciliation (v2.6).

Deterministic core of the "catch any path to sensitive data without permission"
capability. Operates on the Phase-2 inventories:
  - phase-02-sinks.json        (egress sinks, path-sensitive guarded_paths)
  - phase-02-credentials.json  (credential mint/consume ledger)
optionally enriched by:
  - phase-02-surface.json      (interface catalogue — gates on resolve-layer surfaces)
  - phase-00-profile.json      (public_resources allowlist; default-deny otherwise)

Two responsibilities:

  (A) COVERAGE GATE (fail-closed). If a candidate set is supplied (--candidates or
      --source-root, which runs the lib/egress-detection.md extractor), FAIL if any
      candidate sink/credential site is neither inventoried nor explicitly
      dismissed-with-reason, and FAIL on any sink whose `coverage` is "incomplete".
      A silent omission must break the run, never pass quietly.

  (B) RECONCILIATION (R2-R6). Compute, per (resource, LAYER), the strongest
      INTENDED gate (across every path + every credential that protects it), then
      flag every byte-serving branch whose enforced gate is weaker, every
      credential that no byte-serving path consumes, every capability-only branch
      on a sensitive resource, and (v2.6) every credential landing in a filesystem
      location somebody other than the operator can steer. Emits finding-schema
      JSONL.

This is NOT a soundness proof. It mechanically reconciles an AGENT-POPULATED
inventory; its value is (a) it makes the cross-layer / conditional-bypass /
missing-enforcer class EXPRESSIBLE and checkable, and (b) the coverage gate makes a
*missing* sink loud instead of silent. A clean run = "every known egress path was
accounted for and gated", not "no unauthorized path exists".

v2.6 — WHAT THE FIRST CALIBRATED RUN MEASURED. Across 81 triaged HIGH+ R-rule
findings this family was **19.8% true**. The rules were not the problem: the
`floor` was joined on `serves_resource` alone — a free-text string an inventory
agent wrote — so everything sharing that string was compared to everything else
regardless of layer, process or trust boundary. A Vue click handler was compared
against a cron worker's HMAC gate. v2.6 types that join (`layer`), stops a
credential *kind* from setting a floor nobody can reach, gives the inventory
agent a structured way to state a gate's rank, and stops treating a write to the
operator's own stdout/home as egress to an untrusted caller. See
docs/EPIC-v2.6-calibrated-severity.md §1.4.

Usage:
  python3 lib/validate-egress.py <one-or-more .json inputs> \
      [--surface phase-02-surface.json] [--profile phase-00-profile.json] \
      [--candidates candidates.json | --source-root DIR] \
      [--ignore .claude-audit/ignore.txt] \
      [--partition <id>] [--out findings.jsonl] [--quiet]

Inputs may be passed positionally (classified by their top-level keys, so
`tests/fixtures/egress/deck-bug/*.json` works) or via explicit flags.

Exit codes:
  0  clean — coverage satisfied, no HIGH/CRITICAL deficit
  1  coverage gate failed OR >=1 HIGH/CRITICAL Authorized-Egress finding

# coarse — the signal is the DELTA between paths to the same resource, not the
# absolute number. Keep this table in sync with lib/egress-detection.md.

# --- Layer typing (v2.6 story 2.4) -----------------------------------------
# WHY. v2.5 keyed the gate `floor` on `serves_resource` alone. That string is
# free text an inventory agent wrote, so a browser component, a developer CLI, a
# cron worker and an HTTP handler all landed in one comparison bucket the moment
# they named the same entity. Two measured false positives from the calibrated
# run, both silenced by typing the join:
#   * a `console.log(JSON.stringify(summary))` in a developer's own CLI, flagged
#     because the resource's floor came from a CRON SCHEDULER resolve-layer
#     surface;
#   * `ExportCsvButton.vue:31` — a client-side `<a download>` click — flagged for
#     not enforcing a server gate that lives in
#     `server/api/v1/reports/export.get.ts`.
# A Vue click handler cannot enforce a gate and a cron worker's HMAC is not a
# weaker sibling of an HTTP RBAC check. Neither is a bug in the IDEA of R5; both
# are the consequence of joining on an untyped string. [EPIC v2.6 §1.4(c)]
LAYERS = ("http", "browser", "cli", "worker", "build", "ipc")

# The default is `http` on purpose: it is the layer that faces an untrusted
# remote caller, and it is also the bucket every un-typed row landed in before
# v2.6. So an inventory that sets no `layer` anywhere reconciles EXACTLY as v2.5
# did — layer typing can only ever split a bucket, never silently drop a row.
DEFAULT_LAYER = "http"

# Ordered; first match wins. Specific beats generic — `server/workers/` must be
# read as a worker before `server/` is read as an HTTP handler.
#
# `app/` is the trap. It is the browser directory in Nuxt 4 (the calibration
# target) and server code in Rails (`app/controllers`), Laravel (`app/Http`),
# Flask and FastAPI. So `app/` alone means nothing here: the browser rule matches
# `app/` only when followed by a client-shaped subdirectory, and Rails/Laravel's
# server subdirectories are claimed explicitly above it. Anything unrecognised
# falls through to the `http` default, which is the conservative direction —
# `http` is the bucket everything shared before v2.6, so a bad guess costs a
# false positive, never a silent drop. The schemas tell agents to set `layer`
# explicitly wherever the path is ambiguous; this table is only the fallback.

# real credential gaps and 129 real collection gaps. So a filesystem write only
# becomes a candidate when the same line also names something credential-shaped,
# which is exactly the case the triage found. The residual gap is stated in
