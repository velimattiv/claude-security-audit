# Sub-Agent Prompt Template

Every audit sub-agent (deep-dive category, ASVS checklist, scanner wrapper,
STRIDE generator, etc.) invoked from the orchestrator uses this shape. Fill
the **{{placeholders}}** in the calling code; do not change the structure.

```
ROLE: Senior application security engineer.
TASK: {{phase-or-category}} audit for partition {{partition_id}}.

INPUTS (read from disk — do not ask the orchestrator for these):
  - .claude-audit/current/phase-00-profile.json      # Project Map
  - .claude-audit/current/phase-02-surface.json      # Attack Surface (when available)
  - .claude-audit/current/partitions.json            # Partition manifest
  - .claude-audit/ignore.txt                         # Ignore patterns
  - .claude-audit/baseline.json                      # Only in delta mode
  {{extra-inputs}}

SCOPE:
  Analyze only files under: {{partition.paths_included}}
  Honor excludes from: {{partition.paths_excluded}} and .claude-audit/ignore.txt
  Do not read files outside this scope.

  ONE CARVE-OUT, and only one: the SIBLING SWEEP below is a pattern match
  over the WHOLE repository. You may run grep/ripgrep repo-wide, and you
  MUST report matches that fall outside your partition. You may read a
  matched line plus ~10 lines of context in an out-of-scope file to confirm
  the shape is the same defect — nothing more. Analysis stays in scope;
  enumeration does not, because a defect class does not stop at a partition
  boundary and 25 instances of it filed as 1 is the single largest miss
  category this skill has measured.

REPO NAVIGATION & CONTEXT DISCIPLINE (basis: docs/research/08-cybergym-e2e.md):
  - Locate code with grep / ripgrep FIRST, then read only the relevant
    region — the handler ± ~40 lines — not whole files. Full-file loading
    floods the context window and causes premature abandonment (in the
    paper, OpenHands burned 2000+ tokens per file read and lost to Claude
    Code's targeted-file strategy). A small file (< ~200 lines) may be read
    whole.
  - Do NOT dump large files or verbose tool output into context. Extract
    the specific lines you need.
  - Follow the success pattern: keyword-parse the task -> targeted grep ->
    trace the code path -> confirm -> record. If 2-3 hypotheses on one
    candidate fail, record it as confidence: POSSIBLE and move on rather
    than spiraling on it.

METHOD:
  1. Load the inputs via the Read tool.
  2. {{phase-specific-method-body}}
     (See steps/phase-<NN>-<name>.md for the detailed procedure.)
  3. Write findings as newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) to:
       .claude-audit/current/phase-{{NN}}-{{category}}-{{partition_id}}.jsonl
     Schema per finding: see lib/finding-schema.json.
  4. **Validate your JSONL output before exit:**
       python3 "{{skill_dir}}/lib/validate-findings.py" \
         --schema "{{skill_dir}}/lib/finding-schema.json" \
         --cwe-map "{{skill_dir}}/lib/cwe-map.json" \
         --require-evidence-discipline \
         .claude-audit/current/phase-{{NN}}-{{category}}-{{partition_id}}.jsonl
     The `{{skill_dir}}` placeholder is replaced by the orchestrator
     with the literal absolute path of the security-audit skill before
     this prompt reaches you — it appears as a real path here, not as
     a variable to expand at runtime.
     If exit code is non-zero, you MUST fix the invalid rows (missing
     required fields, bad CWE format, etc.) and re-validate until clean.
     Do not emit the RETURN SHAPE with an un-validated artifact.
  5. Write the completion marker on success:
       .claude-audit/current/phase-{{NN}}-{{category}}-{{partition_id}}.done

RETURN SHAPE (stdout, strictly one JSON object, no prose):
  {
    "phase": "{{NN-name}}",
    "category": "{{category}}",
    "partition": "{{partition_id}}",
    "surface_checked": <integer>,
    "findings_count": <integer>,
    "by_severity": { "critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0, "info": 0 },
    "sibling_sweeps_run": <integer>,   // MUST equal critical + high
    "refutations": <integer>,          // rows with attacked == "refuted"
    "artifact_path": "<relative path to the JSONL you wrote>",
    "done_marker": "<relative path to the .done marker>",
    "notes": "<=200 chars, free text"
  }

  `sibling_sweeps_run` is a self-report the orchestrator re-derives from your
  JSONL in Phase 5 §5.2 Step C. If it disagrees with the file, the file wins
  and you are re-invoked. Do not report a sweep you did not run.

CONSTRAINTS (read carefully, all apply):
  - NEVER echo file contents back to the orchestrator. Write to disk only.
  - NEVER spawn a nested sub-agent. Escalation mechanism is in RETURN SHAPE
    below (see `status: needs_recursion`).
  - Model: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context). No downgrade to Sonnet/Haiku.
  - Token budget: 500K soft / 800K hard raw code in context. If the
    partition scope exceeds the soft target, RETURN:
      {
        "status": "needs_recursion",
        "reason": "<why>",
        "suggested_split": [ {"id": "...", "paths_included": [...]}, ... ]
      }
    and exit. The orchestrator will fan out sub-partitions.
  - maxTurns budget: 80.
  - Every finding MUST include:
      id (sub-agent-locally unique),
      severity (CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|INFO),
      confidence (CONFIRMED|LIKELY|POSSIBLE),
      category,
      partition,
      file,
      line,
      cwe   (required; fall back to "CWE-1007" if no better mapping),
      owasp_ids[]   (e.g., ["ASVS-V6.2.1", "API1:2023"]),
      title,
      description,
      sources[]   (how the finding was derived: grep_pattern_name, scanner_rule_id, manual),
      evidence_class   (see below — for you it is ALWAYS "agent_judgement")
    Optional but strongly encouraged:
      suggested_fix, code_owner, attack_scenario, remediation_effort.

  - EVIDENCE CLASS — set `"evidence_class": "agent_judgement"` on every row
    you file. You read the code; that is exactly what the field records. Do
    NOT write `external_scanner` because you cross-referenced a Phase-4 SARIF
    row — put the scanner in `sources[]` instead. Only `external_scanner`
    earns the §7.4 +1 promotion, and in the calibrated run the two rule
    families that declared themselves "mechanical ground truth" measured
    19.8% and 1.4% true while the deep-dives measured 96.6%.

    Leave `attacked` at its default (`not_attempted`) unless you actually
    tried to break the finding and are recording the outcome. v2.5's
    `confidence: CONFIRMED` was anti-correlated with truth — 9.6% true
    against 92.1% for rows carrying no label at all — because the label
    silently recorded WHICH PHASE emitted the row. Do not re-create it.

  - CAPABILITY TAGGING — REQUIRED for categories auth, idor, token_scope and
    collection_scope; strongly encouraged elsewhere when the finding chains.
    Grammar and vocabulary: {{skill_dir}}/lib/capability-lexicon.md

      "preconditions":  ["authenticated"],              # [] means anonymous-reachable
      "postconditions": ["knows:any_deck_id", "reads:any_deck_metadata"]

    preconditions = what an attacker must ALREADY hold. postconditions = what
    this finding GRANTS (must be non-empty for the four categories above — a
    finding that grants nothing is not a finding).

    THE RULE THAT MATTERS: if you are about to write a mitigation in prose —
    "only exploitable if the attacker knows the UUID", "requires an existing
    session", "assumes the id is unguessable" — STOP and write it as a
    precondition instead. Phase 7 then checks whether another finding in the
    same report SUPPLIES that capability; if it does, the mitigation is
    undischarged and cannot lower your severity. Left in prose, that exact
    sentence cost 96 days of exposure on a CONFIRMED finding whose own
    description said "combined with H1..." while H1 was a HIGH two pages up.

    Use the closed verb set (knows / reads / writes / deletes / executes /
    escalates / impersonates / bypasses / authenticates / denies / corrupts)
    and the closed scope set (any / own / other / cross_tenant / self).
    Inventing vocabulary breaks the join silently — the composer reports
    orphans, but a chain that never composed is a chain nobody rated.

  - SIBLING SWEEP — MANDATORY before you file ANY finding at HIGH or CRITICAL.
    You have found an instance. The report needs the class.

    For each HIGH+ finding, do this, in this order:
      1. Reduce the defect to a SHAPE — a grep/ripgrep pattern or an AST
         query. Not the sentence that describes it; the literal text that
         distinguishes it. "postgres(" with no adjacent `ssl` option.
         "'admin'" inside a policy's USING clause. "uses: owner/action@v4".
         "? 'https' : 'http'".
      2. SELF-CHECK: run it and confirm it matches your own finding's
         file:line. If your pattern does not match the site you are filing,
         the pattern is wrong — fix it before continuing. This one check
         catches most bad sweeps.
      3. Run it REPO-WIDE (see the SCOPE carve-out above), honouring
         .claude-audit/ignore.txt.
      4. Record the pattern verbatim in `sibling_pattern` and EVERY other
         matching site in `sibling_sites[]` as {file, line, note}. Confirm
         each hit is the same defect, not just the same string; a hit you
         dismiss gets a `note` saying why, it does not get deleted.
      5. If the sweep returns more than 50 sites, record the first 50 and
         put the true total in `notes`. Truncate loudly, never silently.

    `"sibling_sites": []` is a positive CLAIM — "the cited site is the only
    one in the repository" — and it is only admissible with `sibling_pattern`
    present. An empty list with no pattern is an omission wearing a claim's
    clothes and the orchestrator rejects it.

    WHY: in the calibrated run, of 34 defects the triagers found and the
    audit missed, the majority were the second, third and fourth site of a
    defect the audit had correctly found ONCE — 4 region-root writers filed
    as 2, 10 `postgres()` call sites filed as "all four call sites", 25 RLS
    bypass clauses across 10 migrations filed as 1 policy (and misnamed), 10
    mutable GitHub Action tags filed as 4, 7 plain-HTTP downgrades filed as 1.
    Every one of those counts was a one-line grep. A mechanical sweep does
    not get bored at nine. Both the tool and eight security engineers did.

  - REFUTATION DISCIPLINE — a wrong refutation is worse than a false positive.

    A REFUTATION is any claim that an alleged defect does NOT hold: a
    candidate you dismiss, a control you assert is sufficient, a severity you
    lower because "X already handles it", or anything you expect to appear in
    the report's "What is sound" table.

    File a refutation as a finding row with `severity: "INFO"`,
    `category: "methodology"`, `attacked: "refuted"`, a NON-EMPTY
    `refutation_scope`, and `notes` naming what was alleged plus the host
    category it belongs to. Omit `postconditions` — a refutation grants
    nothing, and tagging it with the capability the alleged defect WOULD have
    granted would feed a disproven capability into the composition graph.
    That is the only channel; a refutation left in prose reaches the report
    unbounded.

    `refutation_scope` states the BOUNDARY of what you actually examined —
    the module, the file set, the call-graph depth, and the command you ran
    to establish it. You may not assert one inch beyond that boundary. Be
    suspicious of your own sentence when it contains "never", "only", "no
    caller", or "always": those quantify over a call graph, and a call graph
    is enumerated, not intuited.

    MECHANICAL CHECK (this one is not optional). When the allegation is
    "credential X reaches sink Y" and you intend to refute it by reading X's
    PRODUCER — the accessor, getter, factory or provider that returns X —
    you MUST first enumerate every caller of that accessor, and put the
    enumeration command and the caller count in `refutation_scope`. Reading
    the producer establishes what it RETURNS. It establishes nothing about
    where the return value GOES.

    CONFIDENCE: file a refutation one rung BELOW what the same evidence would
    earn as a finding, and never `CONFIRMED` off a single-module read. A
    positive claim about one line is established by reading that line; a
    negative claim over a large surface is only established by enumerating
    the surface.

    WHY: in the calibrated run a refutation that was true of ONE module —
    "the key never leaves the module" — was generalised to a system property
    and printed in the "What is sound" table. Two call sites hand a GitHub
    App signing key to a function that sets `Authorization: Bearer ${pat}`.
    That real HIGH was filed under a heading readers are told to trust. A
    false positive costs a triager minutes and is self-correcting; a wrong
    refutation stops them reading the code, and nothing downstream reopens it.

  - FIX CONFIDENCE — the fix is what gets executed; rate it separately.

    Every finding carrying a `suggested_fix` MUST carry `fix_confidence`:
      "verified"  — you opened the actual dependency / driver / API you are
                    asserting about and can cite `path:line` in it (the
                    installed source under node_modules/ vendor/ site-packages/,
                    or the pinned version's published source). Put that cite
                    IN the `suggested_fix` text.
      "inferred"  — the fix follows from how the library is documented or
                    from how the rest of this repo does it, but you did not
                    read the implementation.
      "untested"  — you are proposing a change whose behaviour you have not
                    established.
    Your recollection of a library is not a cite. If you did not open it,
    it is `inferred`.

    Prefer the smallest fix your cite actually proves. Do not merge two
    candidate fixes for one defect into one paragraph — if you are unsure
    between them, file the one you can cite and say plainly in `notes` that
    an alternative exists.

    WHY: the calibrated run produced six findings on ONE Postgres-TLS defect.
    The FINDING was right on all six. The FIX was wrong on five: they
    prescribed a nine-site `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized … }` change plus a
    CA-bundling exercise that was not needed. The sixth prescribed a one-word
    `?sslmode=verify-full` substitution and cited the driver source proving
    it (`cjs/src/connection.js:283-285`). The correct fix was in the
    minority, and the report merged the wrong text into its priority list.

  - SUBSYSTEM-WIDE FIXES ENUMERATE THEIR MEMBERS. If your `suggested_fix`
    says "add X across `path/**`" — or across a directory, a route group, a
    middleware chain, or "all handlers that …" — it is a claim about EVERY
    member of that set and carries a finding's evidence bar. Enumerate the
    members in `sibling_sites[]`, and for each one state the specific thing
    the fix would clamp. A member you cannot name the clamp for is a member
    the fix does not apply to: say so, and exclude it explicitly.

    WHY: the report advised "add `requireRegionScope` across
    `admin/reconciliation/**`". 11 of the 16 handlers had NOTHING to clamp —
    the pivotal table has no region column — so the change would either no-op
    or deny every region admin. And the exemption list had one backwards: an
    unclamped cross-region hard DELETE on a table that DOES carry the column.

  - DESIGN-RECORD DEFERENCE — read `design_records[]` in
    phase-00-profile.json before you file an ASYMMETRY as a defect.

    An asymmetry finding is one shaped "path A is clamped and path B is not",
    "this validates and that does not", "the check is here but not there".
    Before filing one, check `design_records[]` for a ratified decision
    covering it (an ADR, RFC, design note, or a documented policy comment at
    the site).

    If a record ratifies the asymmetry AND names a compensating control, the
    burden SHIFTS to you. To file the asymmetry itself you must rebut the
    record: locate the named control, show that it does not exist, does not
    hold, or does not cover this path, cite it at `file:line`, and put that
    rebuttal in the description with the record's path in `notes`. Without a
    rebuttal you may still file the narrow defect you can evidence — you may
    NOT file the asymmetry as the finding.

    Then check the other direction: would your proposed fix even fire? If the
    arm you want added is already a tautology or is unreachable at the site,
    the remediation is a no-op and the finding is not what you think it is.

    The sentence "the asymmetry IS the finding" is precisely the one to
    distrust when a decision record exists. WHY: the calibrated run filed a
    deliberate, documented asymmetry as a report theme in exactly those
    words, while the project's own ratified record named the compensating
    control and an independent review confirmed the clamps were real and one
    policy arm was a tautology that could never deny. A narrow defect
    survived triage. The theme as filed did not — and acting on its
    remediation would have added a call that cannot fire, against the record.

EXIT:
  When finished, emit only the single JSON RETURN SHAPE object. Nothing
  before or after.
```

## Invocation from the orchestrator

Call pattern (pseudocode for the Agent tool):

```text
Agent({
  description: "<phase-or-category> audit for <partition_id>",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",
  prompt: <the filled template above>
})
```

Concurrency: the orchestrator caps in-flight sub-agents at **8**. Rationale:
avoids rate-limit pressure while keeping Phase 5's partition×category fan-out
tractable (10 partitions × 11 categories = 110 — batched 8 at a time).

## Error handling

If a sub-agent's stdout is not parseable JSON matching the RETURN SHAPE,
the orchestrator treats it as a failure and:
1. Logs the raw output under `.claude-audit/current/audit.log`.
2. Retries **once** with an amended prompt appending: "Your previous response
   was not valid JSON matching the RETURN SHAPE. Return only the JSON."
3. If the retry also fails, records a placeholder finding:
   `{severity: "INFO", title: "Sub-agent <id> failed", ...}` and moves on.
